--=================================================================================
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS book_data_sold;

--=================================================================================
-- CREATE book_data_sold table 
--=================================================================================
CREATE TABLE book_data_sold(
book_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
book_title VARCHAR(50),

### 1. Create ranking based on price which the most expensive book comes first.

```sql
SELECT
	*,
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY price DESC) as price_ranking
FROM book_data_sold;
```
![Library_project](https://github.com/imdwipayana/PostgreSQL/blob/main/Practice/WINDOWS%20FUNCTION/RANKING%20WINDOW%20FUNCTIONS/image/number1.png)

### 2. For each genre, list the price of book starting from the most expensive.

```sql
SELECT
	*,
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY genre ORDER BY price DESC) as price_ranking
FROM book_data_sold;
```
![Library_project](https://github.com/imdwipayana/PostgreSQL/blob/main/Practice/WINDOWS%20FUNCTION/RANKING%20WINDOW%20FUNCTIONS/image/number2.png)

### 3. Find the most expensive book for each genre.

Add constrain to previous problem with WHERE

```sql
SELECT
	*
FROM (SELECT
	     *,
	     ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY genre ORDER BY price DESC) as price_ranking
      FROM book_data_sold
)
WHERE price_ranking = 1;
```
![Library_project](https://github.com/imdwipayana/PostgreSQL/blob/main/Practice/WINDOWS%20FUNCTION/RANKING%20WINDOW%20FUNCTIONS/image/number3.png)

### 4. Compares ROW_NUMBER(), RANK() and DENSE_RANK window function to sort the book based on the number books in stock.

```sql
SELECT
	book_id,
	book_title,
	in_stock,
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY in_stock DESC) as unique_rank,
	RANK() OVER(ORDER BY in_stock DESC) as share_rank,
	DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY in_stock DESC) as rank_dense
FROM book_data_sold;
```
![Library_project](https://github.com/imdwipayana/PostgreSQL/blob/main/Practice/WINDOWS%20FUNCTION/RANKING%20WINDOW%20FUNCTIONS/image/number4.png)

### 5. Compares ROW_NUMBER(), RANK() and DENSE_RANK window function to sort the book based on the number books were sold.


```sql
SELECT
	book_id,
	book_title,
	number_sold,
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY number_sold DESC) as unique_rank,
	RANK() OVER(ORDER BY number_sold DESC) as share_rank,
	DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY number_sold DESC) as rank_dense
FROM book_data_sold;
```
![Library_project](https://github.com/imdwipayana/PostgreSQL/blob/main/Practice/WINDOWS%20FUNCTION/RANKING%20WINDOW%20FUNCTIONS/image/number5.png)

### 6. Rank the best 3 book titles that were sold.

First step: counting sales as number book sold multiply by the price of the book.
```sql
SELECT
	*,
	number_sold*price as sales
FROM book_data_sold;
```
![Library_project](https://github.com/imdwipayana/PostgreSQL/blob/main/Practice/WINDOWS%20FUNCTION/RANKING%20WINDOW%20FUNCTIONS/image/number6step1.png)

Second step: use ROW_NUMBER() to rank the book based on sales.
```sql
SELECT
	*,
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY sales DESC) as rank_sales
FROM (
SELECT
	*,
	number_sold*price as sales
FROM book_data_sold
);
```
![Library_project](https://github.com/imdwipayana/PostgreSQL/blob/main/Practice/WINDOWS%20FUNCTION/RANKING%20WINDOW%20FUNCTIONS/image/number6step2.png)

Thirsd step: use LIMIT to find out the top three book sales.
```sql
SELECT
	*,
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY sales DESC) as rank_sales
FROM (SELECT
	     *,
	     number_sold*price as sales
      FROM book_data_sold
)
LIMIT 3;
```
![Library_project](https://github.com/imdwipayana/PostgreSQL/blob/main/Practice/WINDOWS%20FUNCTION/RANKING%20WINDOW%20FUNCTIONS/image/number6step3.png)

### 7. USE NTILE() to divide the book data through some groups based on price.

```sql
SELECT
	*,
	NTILE(1) OVER(ORDER BY price DESC) as one_group,
	NTILE(2) OVER(ORDER BY price DESC) as two_groups,
	NTILE(3) OVER(ORDER BY price DESC) as three_groups,
	NTILE(4) OVER(ORDER BY price DESC) as four_groups,
	NTILE(5) OVER(ORDER BY price DESC) as five_groups,
	NTILE(6) OVER(ORDER BY price DESC) as six_groups
FROM book_data_sold;
```
![Library_project](https://github.com/imdwipayana/PostgreSQL/blob/main/Practice/WINDOWS%20FUNCTION/RANKING%20WINDOW%20FUNCTIONS/image/number7.png)

### 8. USE NTILE() to categorize the book based on price into 3 groups: expensive, medium and cheap

First step: use NTILE(3) to group table into 3 category
```sql
SELECT
	*,
	NTILE(3) OVER(ORDER BY price DESC) as three_group
FROM book_data_sold;
```
![Library_project](https://github.com/imdwipayana/PostgreSQL/blob/main/Practice/WINDOWS%20FUNCTION/RANKING%20WINDOW%20FUNCTIONS/image/number8step1.png)

-- Second step: use CASE to categorize data based on the NTILE() result
```sql
SELECT
	*,
	CASE
		WHEN three_group = 1 THEN 'expensive'
		WHEN three_group = 2 THEN 'medium'
		ELSE 'cheap'
	END as price_category
FROM (SELECT
	     *,
	  NTILE(3) OVER(ORDER BY price DESC) as three_group
      FROM book_data_sold
);
```
![Library_project](https://github.com/imdwipayana/PostgreSQL/blob/main/Practice/WINDOWS%20FUNCTION/RANKING%20WINDOW%20FUNCTIONS/image/number8step2.png)

### 9. Categorize the books to be two groups based on sales: top_selling and less_selling

First step: calculate sales for each book.
```sql
SELECT
	*,
	number_sold*price as sales
FROM book_data_sold;
```
![Library_project](https://github.com/imdwipayana/PostgreSQL/blob/main/Practice/WINDOWS%20FUNCTION/RANKING%20WINDOW%20FUNCTIONS/image/number9step1.png)

Second step: use NTILE(2) to divide the sales becomes two groups.
```sql
SELECT
	*,
	NTILE(2) OVER(ORDER BY sales DESC) as sales_category
FROM (SELECT
	     *,
	     number_sold*price as sales
      FROM book_data_sold
);
```
![Library_project](https://github.com/imdwipayana/PostgreSQL/blob/main/Practice/WINDOWS%20FUNCTION/RANKING%20WINDOW%20FUNCTIONS/image/number9step2.png)

Third step: use CASE to make category based on sales
```sql
SELECT
	*,
	CASE
		WHEN sales_category = 1 THEN 'top_selling'
		ELSE 'less_selling'
	END as top_less_selling
FROM (SELECT
         *,
	     NTILE(2) OVER(ORDER BY sales DESC) as sales_category
      FROM (SELECT
	           *,
	           number_sold*price as sales
            FROM book_data_sold
)
);
```
![Library_project](https://github.com/imdwipayana/PostgreSQL/blob/main/Practice/WINDOWS%20FUNCTION/RANKING%20WINDOW%20FUNCTIONS/image/number9step3.png)

### 10. USE CUME_DIST() to find out the top 40% from book price

First step: use CUM_DIST() to find the top percentage
```sql
SELECT
	*,
	CUME_DIST() OVER(ORDER BY price DESC) as cumulative_dist 
FROM book_data_sold;
```
![Library_project](https://github.com/imdwipayana/PostgreSQL/blob/main/Practice/WINDOWS%20FUNCTION/RANKING%20WINDOW%20FUNCTIONS/image/number10step1.png)

Second step: use WHERE to constrain the only top 40%
```sql
SELECT
	*
FROM(SELECT
	    *,
	 CUME_DIST() OVER(ORDER BY price DESC) as cumulative_dist 
     FROM book_data_sold
)
WHERE cumulative_dist<=0.4;
```
![Library_project](https://github.com/imdwipayana/PostgreSQL/blob/main/Practice/WINDOWS%20FUNCTION/RANKING%20WINDOW%20FUNCTIONS/image/number10step2.png)

Third step: use CONCAT to write in percentage
```sql
SELECT
	*,
	CONCAT(cumulative_dist*100,'%') as percentage_dist
FROM (SELECT
  	     *
      FROM(SELECT
      	      *,
	          CUME_DIST() OVER(ORDER BY price DESC) as cumulative_dist 
           FROM book_data_sold
)
WHERE cumulative_dist<=0.4
);
```
![Library_project](https://github.com/imdwipayana/PostgreSQL/blob/main/Practice/WINDOWS%20FUNCTION/RANKING%20WINDOW%20FUNCTIONS/image/number10step3.png)

### 11. USE PERCENT_RANK() to find out the top 40% from book price

First step: use CUM_DIST() to find the top percentage

```sql
SELECT
	*,
	PERCENT_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY price DESC)::numeric(10,2) as cumulative_dist 
FROM book_data_sold;
```
![Library_project](https://github.com/imdwipayana/PostgreSQL/blob/main/Practice/WINDOWS%20FUNCTION/RANKING%20WINDOW%20FUNCTIONS/image/number11step1.png)


Second step: use WHERE to constrain the only top 40%
```sql
SELECT
	*
FROM(SELECT
	    *,
	 PERCENT_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY price DESC)::numeric(10,2) as cumulative_dist 
     FROM book_data_sold
)
WHERE cumulative_dist<=0.4;
```
![Library_project](https://github.com/imdwipayana/PostgreSQL/blob/main/Practice/WINDOWS%20FUNCTION/RANKING%20WINDOW%20FUNCTIONS/image/number11step2.png)

Third step: use CONCAT to write in percentage
```sql
SELECT
	*,
	CONCAT(cumulative_dist*100,'%') as percentage_dist
FROM (SELECT
  	     *
      FROM(SELECT
      	      *,
	          PERCENT_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY price DESC)::numeric(10,2) as cumulative_dist 
           FROM book_data_sold
)
WHERE cumulative_dist<=0.4
);
```
![Library_project](https://github.com/imdwipayana/PostgreSQL/blob/main/Practice/WINDOWS%20FUNCTION/RANKING%20WINDOW%20FUNCTIONS/image/number11step3.png)

### 12. Compare CUME_DIST() and PERCENT_RANK() from book price

```sql
SELECT
	*,
	CUME_DIST() OVER(ORDER BY price DESC)::numeric(10,2) as example_cume_dist,
	PERCENT_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY price DESC)::numeric(10,2) as example_percent_rank
FROM book_data_sold;
```
